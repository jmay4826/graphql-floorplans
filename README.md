# graphql-floorplans

This project is a refactor of an [older project](https://github.com/jmay4826/server), replacing the REST API backend with GraphQL. This version is still a work in progress, so check out [the previous one](https://github.com/jmay4826/server) for a full demo!


The [front end](https://github.com/jmay4826/floorplans-nextjs) of this project has also been rewritten from the ground up in React using Next.js with Apollo and GraphQL.
